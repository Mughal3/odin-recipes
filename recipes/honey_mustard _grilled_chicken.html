        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> A type of mustard made with a combination of herbs and spices 
                blended into a mustard base that is sweetened with honey. 
                It is popular as a condiment for sandwiches, 
                as a dipping sauce for pretzels or stick snacks, 
                or as a flavoring that is brushed on meat near the end of the cooking process, 
                much like a barbecue sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup Dijon mustard </li>
                <li>¼ cup honey </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise  </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon steak sauce  </li>
                <li> ¼ large baguette, sliced </li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the grill for medium heat.</li>
                <li>In a shallow bowl, mix the mustard, honey, mayonnaise, and steak sauce. 
                    Set aside a small amount of the honey mustard sauce for basting, 
                    and dip the chicken into the remaining sauce to coat.</li>
                <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken over indirect heat for 18 to 20 minutes, 
                    turning occasionally, or until juices run clear. 
                    Baste occasionally with the reserved sauce during the last 10 minutes. 
                    Watch carefully to prevent burning!</li>
            </ol>
